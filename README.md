## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
ZETA is a distributed framework aims to support zero-trust in the elasticity operations edge-cloud microservices. It is a platform-agnostic framework that can evaluate contextual trust levels. ZETA takes into consideration a high-level view of the platform services that are deployed on cloud. For more details, checkout the wiki page.


## Dependencies <a name="dependencies"></a>
The baseline ZETA requires
* Docker and docker-compose

There are a few additional external dependencies if you want to generate plots and stress test ZETA. They include:
* k6.io
* Jupyter

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
The installation of ZETA is quite straight-forward. Although you may have to be careful about the providing the correct manifest. 

Steps: 

* Provide the correct `influxDB.conf`configurations and mount it during the runtime.
* _(First Time only)_ Run the init.db when the observed-knowledge component starts up.
* Edit the `trust-computation/trust_config.yaml` values.
* Put your public/private keypair in the authorization service component
* _(Optional)_ Supplement the `gp_regression.py` with your own.
* Fill the docker-compose.yml config variables
* create .env file for sensitive environment variables

_Environment variables:_
| Variable Name              | Description                                       |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| SERVICE_KNOWLEDGE_USERNAME | Username for service knowledge component          |
| SERVICE_KNOWLEDGE_PASSWORD | Password for service knowledge component          |
| INFLUXDB_INIT_PASSWORD     | Password for InfluxDB                             |
| INFLUXDB_INIT_USERNAME     | Username for InfluxDB                             |
| INFLUXDB_INIT_BUCKET       | Bucket Name for InfluxDB (Optional)               |
| INFLUXDB_INIT_ORG          | Default organization name for InfluxDB (Optional) |

Finally, start the docker-compose.yml services
